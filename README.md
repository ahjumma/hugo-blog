# Summary
This is a Hugo-based blogging project for my personal blogging posts.

I am utilizing a theme based on [Coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder), and I have modified it to suit my needs such as categorization and displaying categories for each post.

Currently, Travis CI is being used to build and deploy my static web site on Github Pages.
