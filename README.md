# Summary
This is a Hugo-based blogging project for my personal blogging posts.

I am utilizing a theme based on [Coder]() and I have modified it to suit my needs such as categorization and displaying categories for each post.

This is a test build to incorporate TravisCI in deploying my static site on Github Pages.
